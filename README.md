## Author Notes
I slightly overengineered it to showcase some of my ruby knowledge (or at least whatever was possible without bundling and using some extra gems I would have in rails). I usually KISS and don't go ahead and break a 10 line class into a concern until refactoring phase, so IMHO, this code is looking nice but far from what I would consider worthy of shipping.
